# Instructions

Ok, so you're starting to feel like a real programmer and responsive design looks pretty easy right? Well, try out a real world example.

Here's what you should do:

-Remember what we just learned about responsive design: mobile first, how to construct a media query, etc.

-Include the SVGs as `img` elements - we will cover SVGs later on in a bonus lesson

-Match the mobile-first breakpoints Uber is using:
  545px for mobiles
  768px for tablets

-Think about how this layout will work. Draw it out if you have to. I'd recommend using flexbox here.

-Also think about the flow of the content and why what they've done looks so good. All the content is the same size! Something to consider for your next project.

-Don't worry about matching the font - it's custom and $$$.

-Content:
Heading 1: Easiest way around
Para 1: One tap and a car comes directly to you. Hop in—your driver knows exactly where to go. And when you get there, just step out. Payment is completely seamless.

Heading 2: Anywhere, anytime
Para 2: Daily commute. Errand across town. Early morning flight. Late night drinks. Wherever you’re headed, count on Uber for a ride—no reservations required.

Heading 3: Low-cost to luxury
Para 3: Economy cars at everyday prices are always available. For special occasions, no occasion at all, or when you just need a bit more room, call a black car or SUV.
